This library provides basic functionality for parsing mime-types names and
matching them against a list of media-ranges. See [section 14.1][http-accept] of
[RFC 2616 (the HTTP specification)][http] for a complete explanation. More
information on the library can be found in the XML.com article
"[Just use Media Types?][jgregorio-restful]"

This library was taken from the [original mimeparse library][mimeparse]
on Google Project Hosting and has been cleaned up to conform to [PSR-1][],
[PSR-2][], and [PSR-4][] standards. It also now has support for [Composer][].
The Bitworking namespace is a nod to [Joe Gregorio][jgregorio], the original
author of this library.

## Examples

Use Mimeparse to specify a list of media types your application supports and
compare that to the list of media types the user agent accepts (via the
[HTTP Accept][http-accept] header; `$_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT']`). Mimeparse will
give you the best match to send back to the user agent for your list of
supported types or `null` if there is no best match.

```php
<?php
$supportedTypes = array('application/xbel+xml', 'text/xml');
$httpAcceptHeader = 'text/*;q=0.5,*/*; q=0.1';
$mimeType = \Bitworking\Mimeparse::bestMatch($supportedTypes, $httpAcceptHeader);
echo $mimeType; // Should echo "text/xml"
```

You may also use Mimeparse to get the quality value of a specific media type
when compared against a range of media types (from the Accept header, for example).

```php
<?php
$httpAcceptHeader = 'text/*;q=0.3, text/html;q=0.7, text/html;level=1, text/html;level=2;q=0.4, *\/*;q=0.5';
$quality = \Bitworking\Mimeparse::quality('text/html', $httpAcceptHeader);
echo $quality; // Should echo 0.7
```

## Installation

The preferred method of installation is via [Composer][]:

```
php composer.phar require bitworking/mimeparse
```
